# Welcome to the UCincy Grad Bayesian Analysis Group

## About Us
We are a group of graduate statistics students at the University of Cincinnati dedicated to exploring advanced topics in Bayesian statistics. Our group meets weekly to discuss recent papers, share research findings, and work through challenging statistical problems together.

## Meetings
Our meetings are held every Wednesday at 5:00 PM in the Department of Statistics (Room 301). Each week, we tackle a new topic in Bayesian statistics, ranging from theoretical concepts to practical applications.

## This Week's Topic
- **Week 42: Bayesian Methods in Modern Statistics**
  - [Discussion Summary](/week-42/)
  - [R Markdown File](/meeting/2023/11/04/first)
  - [Slides](/meeting/model_comparison.html)


## Join Us
If you're a UC grad student interested in statistics and data science, we'd love to have you join us! Please [contact us](mailto:stats-group@uc.edu) for more information.
