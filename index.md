# Welcome to the UCincy Grad Bayesian Analysis Group

## About Us
We are a group of graduate statistics students at the University of Cincinnati dedicated to exploring advanced topics in Bayesian statistics. Our group meets weekly to discuss recent papers, share research findings, and work through challenging statistical problems together.

## Meetings
Our meetings are held every Wednesday at 5:00 PM in the Department of Statistics (Room 301). Each week, we tackle a new topic in Bayesian statistics, ranging from theoretical concepts to practical applications.

## This Week's Topic
- **Week 8: Bayesian Hierarchical Model**. Bayesian hierarchical models enable the analysis of data with nested structures by allowing individual observations to be informed by group-level parameters. This approach incorporates prior knowledge and assesses uncertainty through probability distributions. It's a flexible statistical method that captures both within-group variability and between-group differences.
  



## Recent Discussions

- **Week 0:** Opening Ceromony [Slide](/meeting/week0/Bayesian_Reading_Group_Intro.pdf)

- **Week 1:** Modelling and Posterior Predictive Check for football data. Yuan introduced the posterior predictive check technique as a general and flexible bayesian model checking method. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week1/football_normal.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week1/football_normal.html).

- **Week 2:** Modelling for airline fatalities data. Jiwon used Poisson model with and without considering the passenger miles to model the airline fatalities data. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week2/BDAanalysis.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week2/BDAanalysis.html).

- **Week 3:** Non-informative Prior. Kyle summarized the common non-informative priors and apply them on 2022 American birth data. He also provided the examples of prior in clinical trials. [Slide](/meeting/week3/UninformativePriorDistribution.pdf)

- **Week 4:**
  - Theory of Weakly informative Prior. Hancheng explained the implication of weakly informative prior and applied this idea to the airline fatalities data. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week2/BDAanalysis.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week2/BDAanalysis.html).
  - Advantages of using weakly informative Prior. Yuan presented two examples, one is the estimation of sex ratio, where he showed using prior information can prevent the absurd results from appearing, and in logsitic regression with complete separation, weakly informative prior gives more resonable results. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week2/BDAanalysis.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week2/BDAanalysis.html).
  - Frequentist properties of weakly informative prior in sex ratio example. Kyle argued that the use of N(0,0.007) for the difference parameter in probability $p_1-p_2$ will result in close to 0 power. [Pdf]().

- **Week 5:**
  - Theory of Model Comparison Criterions: Yuan explained some widely used bayesian model comparison criterions such as DIC, WAIC and LOOIC. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week5/model_comparison.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week5/model_comparison.html)
  - Application: Eric showed how to calculate the model comparison criterions for Rstan Models. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week5/Model_comp.Rmd). [html](/meeting/week5/Model_comp.html)
