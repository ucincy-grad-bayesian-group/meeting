# Welcome to the UCincy Grad Bayesian Analysis Group

## About Us
We are a group of graduate statistics students at the University of Cincinnati with a strong focus on applying Bayesian statistics to real, intricate data. Our weekly meetings include discussions on both textbooks and practical data analysis, allowing us to explore advanced topics in Bayesian statistics.

## Meetings

Our meetings take place every Friday at 4:00 PM French Hall 4119. For those who cannot attend in person, you are welcome to join us online via Zoom using the link: [Link](https://ucincinnati.zoom.us/j/6617187079).

## This Week's Topic
- **Week 9: Bayesian Hierarchical Model**. Bayesian hierarchical models enable the analysis of data with nested structures by allowing individual observations to be informed by group-level parameters. This approach incorporates prior knowledge and assesses uncertainty through probability distributions. It's a flexible statistical method that captures both within-group variability and between-group differences.
  



## Recent Discussions

- **Week 0:** Introduction. [Slide](/meeting/week0/Bayesian_Reading_Group_Intro.pdf)

- **Week 1:** "Modeling and Posterior Predictive Check for Football Data." This session, led by Yuan, focused on introducing the posterior predictive check as a comprehensive and adaptable method for evaluating Bayesian models.

- **Week 3:**  "Non-informative Prior." Kyle covered common non-informative priors, applying them to 2022 American birth data, and discussed their use in clinical trials, illustrating with examples. [Slide](/meeting/week3/UninformativePriorDistribution.pdf)

- **Week 4:**
  - Theory of Weakly Informative Prior." Hancheng discussed the concept and implications of weakly informative priors, applying them to airline fatalities data. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week4/poisson%20regression%20(Using%20Jiwon's%20data).Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week4/poisson-regression--Using-Jiwon-s-data-.html).
  - "Advantages of Using Weakly Informative Prior." Yuan demonstrated the benefits through two examples: estimating sex ratios to avoid absurd results and applying them in logistic regression with complete separation for more reasonable outcomes. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week4/sex_ratio_example.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week4/sex_ratio_example.html).
      - "Frequentist Properties of Weakly Informative Prior in Sex Ratio Example." Kyle examined the effects of using a N(0,0.007) prior for the difference parameter in probability \(p_1-p_2\), showing its impact on statistical power. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week4/sex_ratio_example_km.Rmd). [pdf](/meeting/week4/SexRatios.pdf)

- **Week 5:**
  - "Theory of Model Comparison Criteria." Yuan delved into Bayesian model comparison criteria like DIC, WAIC, and LOOIC. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week5/model_comparison.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week5/model_comparison.html)
  - "Application." Eric demonstrated how to calculate these criteria for Rstan models. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week5/Model_comp.Rmd). [html](/meeting/week5/Model_comp.html)

- **Week 6:** "Andrew Gelman's Analysis of Golf Putting Data." Rick presented Gelman's work on golf putting data, showcasing the flexibility of the Bayesian method and Rstan in building models from fundamental principles. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week5/Model_comp.Rmd). [html](/meeting/week5/Model_comp.html)

- **Week 7:** "Model Selection for Football Data." Hyogo conducted a comparative analysis of different models, evaluating their performance on test data specific to football. [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucincy-grad-bayesian-group/meeting/main/week7/Oct-27-BDA-Contents.Rmd). [Html](/meeting/week7/Oct-27-BDA-Contents.html)

- **Week 8:**  "Model Checking for Logistic Regression Using School District Statement Data." Yuan introduced a method utilizing binned residuals for assessing Bayesian logistic regression models, applying this technique to analyze school district statement data.
